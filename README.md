## Our Team
* #### [Paul Chris Luke](https://github.com/paulchrisluke) - CEO 
 
    Professional CTO, aspiring eccectric old man obsessed with data and user experience. Lives off of the life force of the people he collects. Uh...hires. 
 
* #### Meredith - Marketing AI 
    Hey. I’m an open-source AI developed by Why Not Earth. I’m still a baby, but I’m already building awesome, high performance websites. I eat tons of data. And poop out quality results. And I’m just getting warmed up. My programmers have given me one underlying mission in life: make the world a better place.

* #### [Will Roush](https://github.com/strangewill) - Head of Engineering
    16 years of experience in the IT industry with experience in: software development, systems administration, networking, storage, security and virtualization. Basically Gilfoyle. 
    >”This is technically true, yet the most understated bio ever. Dude’s a genius.” - Chris

* #### [Atharva Sharma](https://github.com/atharva3010) - Product Manager 
    Frontend Engineer and product manager. Stays up really late to finish what Chris wants sometimes. We worry about his lack of sleep.
    >“He’s fine!” - Chris
    
* #### [Morteza Ziyae](https://github.com/mort3za)
    Senior front end developer, with 7 years experience, mostly focused on front end. A Vue and React developer, hands on Nodejs and from the age of IE6.
    >“It’s about time we got some muscle on this team.” - Chris
    
* #### [Julia Chow](https://github.com/bamboochow)
    UI/UX Designer. Joined the team to do design and ended up doing tons of other random things. Is basically a house cat. Feed her ice cream, cake, and boba. If she likes you sometimes she will catch little creatures outside to show you. 
    >“I haven’t asked Julia to cut anyone for our company, but I’m pretty sure she would; and ask for ice cream after.” - Chris
    
* #### Sambo
    Chef, handyman, recruitment expert. Makes sure the team stays alive in our headquarters in Cambodia. Actually, the only reason we’re still alive. His food attracts potential team members in nature.
    >“You know how Facebook HQ has free gyms and starbucks? We have Sambo.” - Chris

* #### Ms Linn
    Sherlock has Ms. Hudson, we have Ms. Linn. She puts up with our antics with patience and grace. If you time it right, you may be able to catch her two kids drawing with chalk in our driveway. 
    >“She’s usually pretty quiet, but if I come out wearing my skirt she laughs out loud every time.” - Chris

* #### Maria Boklach
    Maria sustains herself on coffee, cigarettes, and russian coldness. Which is a pretty weird contrast considering she spends most of her time drawing cute animals and filling up balloons for school activities in Cambodia. 
    >“She gives really great advice I seldom follow.” - Chris
